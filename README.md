# AtmosFetch 🌦️

## Project Description
SkyCast is a lightweight web application that allows users to query current weather data for any location on Earth using geographic coordinates. This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering curriculum (Week 5) to master asynchronous JavaScript and public API consumption.

## Features
- **Dynamic API Integration:** Uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch real-time data without an API key.
- **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Implements the JavaScript `fetch()` API and Promises.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technical Requirements Met
- Consumes JSON data from a public endpoint.
- Dynamically updates the DOM with temperature values.
- Deployed via Netlify for public access. https://atmosfetch.netlify.app/
